# The braindead npm phantomjs module insists on having an exact semver match
# or it tries to install it's own version, and typically fails. Which version
# of phantomjs is required is determined by which grunt-contrib-* versions
# require npm phantomjs. Which is hopelessly fragile, and moronic. Phantomjs
# 1.9.8 seems to be the current required version by the dependencies of
# `kibana 3.1.3`.
